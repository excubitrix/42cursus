## :small_orange_diamond: Instructions

Run `make` or `make bonus` to compile and `./minishell` to launch the shell.<br>

## :small_orange_diamond: Features
- The prompt shown when waiting for a new command, is the name of the current directory.
- Commands are searched and launched as they are in bash (based on the PATH variable or by using a relative or an absolute path).
- The following commands are build-in:
 - `echo` with option `-n`
 - `cd` with no argument or a relative or an absolte path
 - `pwd` without any options
 - `export` without any options
 - `unset` without any options
 - `env` without any options or arguments
 - `exit` without any options
- Commands can be separated by `;`, `&`, `&&` or `||`. However, `&` will have the same effect as `;`.
- Quotes `'` and `"` as they work in bash.
- Redirections `<`, `>` and `>>` as they work in bash with the exception of file descriptor aggregation.
- Pipes `|` as they work in bash with the exception of multiline commands.
- Environment variables as they work in in bash.
- `$?` as it works in bash.
- ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ have the same result as they do in bash.
- The up and down arrow keys allow for the user to navigate through the histroy, which can then be edited.
- Custom key sequences that act like [home] and [end].
- Copy and paste up to fifty characters at a time.
- Write and edit multiline commands.
- Wildcard `*` as it works in bash.
