# :large_orange_diamond: ft_containers &ensp; ![42Project Score](https://badge42.herokuapp.com/api/project/floogman/ft_containers)

The objective of this project is to re-implement the following STL containers using the c++98 standard: `map`, `vector` and `stack`.

## :small_orange_diamond: Instructions

To use these versions of `map`, `vector` and `stack` simply `#include` them in your project and prefix their calls with `ft::`.
```
#include "map.hpp"
#include "vector.hpp"
#include "stack.hpp"

int main(void) {
	ft::map<int, int> map_int;
	ft::vector<int> vector_int;
	ft::stack<int> stack_int;

	/* Your Code */

	return 0;
}
```

## :small_orange_diamond: Testing

To test with the `main.cpp` provided by the school, execute the `test.sh` script located in the `./tests` directory.
```
cd tests
./test.sh
```

To run more tests, `cd` into each container's dedicated directory and run the `test.sh` scripts located there.
```
cd map
./test.sh
```
